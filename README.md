DriveClean is a play-to-earn lifestyle app that incentivizes climate-friendly behaviors.

It helps users bring their real-world climate-friendly behaviors on chain as "climate credentials" (stored on IPFS), while earning tokens and enjoying benefits from brand partners.

We start with charge-to-earn for electric vehicles drivers (e.g. Tesla), with additional rewards for clean energy charging.

Over time, we will incorporate different types of climate credentials (from purchase of plant-based burgers to participation in KlimaDAO) and create an ecosystem of brand partners to provide significant real-world benefits.

## Why does DriveClean exist?

Solving climate change requires global coordination of the entire human race.

However, government-led initiatives are not getting us to net zero by 2050.

DriveClean is offering the world an alternative, bottom-up path to carbon neutrality by develop a market-driven, decentralized incentive structures to reward pro-environmental behaviors.


## How does DriveClean use IPFS?

1. **NFT Storage**: Users need to acquire NFTs before starting "play-to-earn". All NFTs are stored on IPFS using nft.storage
2. **Storage of climate credentials**: All EV charging data & user identifiers are stored on IPFS as part of on-chain credentials. These data will accumulate over time and be leveraged by DriveClean and its partner to issue rewards
